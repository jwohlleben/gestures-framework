# gestures-framework
A framework for gesture recognition using machine learning.

## Prerequisites
In order to use this framework, please install
- Android Studio
- python3
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow

## How it works
The *DataRecorder* app records movement using the smartphone's sensors. With the *DesktopApp*, you can automatically build the model. The *ModelTester* app is used to test the models' capability to classify movement.

## Further reading
The idea for this project arose from a uni course. Here, the goal was to dynamically adapt the user interface of a note-taking app to the user's hand. You can read [this](https://www.hciai.uni-bayreuth.de/en/teaching/ciis_ws1920/Project_Raised/index.html) article, if you're intersted. This also shows possible use cases for such a kind of framework.

## Deprecation warning
I don't do any maintenance for this project anymore because I don't have time for it at the moment. This is also an older project, so the code standard is not really good yet :sweat_smile:, but please feel free to be inspired by this project.
